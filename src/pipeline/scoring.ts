// Fact-Checker scoring: pure and deterministic so it can be tested and audited.
//
// Trust score (0–100) = credibility (0–40) + corroboration (0–25)
//                     + primary evidence (0–20) + claim support (0–15) − penalties
//
//   credibility      best non-social source weight, scaled (5.0 => 40)
//   corroboration    independent non-social publishers: 1 => 5, 2 => 20, 3+ => 25
//   primary evidence 5.0 => 20, wire 4.5 => 14, major 4.0 => 10, specialist 3.5 => 5
//   claim support    share of the article's claims the sources actually back (LLM-checked)
//
// An article is published only when ALL gates hold; the score alone is never enough:
//   1. at least one non-social source (social signals are discovery only)
//   2. double-sourced (>= 2 independent non-social publishers) OR backed by a primary source
//      OR, for a topic in SINGLE_SOURCE_OK (passed in by the caller as `singleSourceOk`),
//      one credible specialist-tier source (weight >= SINGLE_SOURCE_MIN_WEIGHT) is enough --
//      genuine double-sourcing is structurally rare for an individual real-estate deal or
//      funding round the way it isn't for a ceasefire every wire service reports at once.
//   3. no claim contradicted by the sources
//   4. at least 70% of claims supported
//   5. score >= PUBLISH_THRESHOLD
//
// `singleSourceOk` is a plain boolean the caller computes (from the article's category and
// georgia_related flag -- see research.ts's evaluateCluster and factcheck.ts's factCheckStage,
// which must both pass the SAME value for a given article or it can pass one gate and fail the
// other). Kept as a parameter, not inferred here, so this module stays pure and testable.
